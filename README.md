Pieflix is a full stack application used to create pairings of pizza companies and movies. The app allows users to search the TMDb database by selecting one of two processes: Find a Film, or Pick a Pizza.

With Find a Film, the user selects a pizza brand and the app searches for a movie using predefined filters. When a paring is displayed, users can click the "Not Feeling It?" button. If they do, pieflix will search the TMDb database for a different film that matches the same query filters. (The rejected movie will not be displayed in their list of previous pairings.)

Alternatively, with Pick a Pizza, the user inputs their selected movie's title and release year into a form, and the app selects a pizza brand.

Both processes are done by filling out a simple form on the New Pair (`/pair`) page. Previous pairings are displayed on the Pairings (`/`) page, where users can also review their previous pairings by clicking on either a thumbs up or thumbs down button. Previous pairings can also be deleted by click on the trash can button.

Users also have the option to share pairings they like on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.

### A note about querying

When an user choses to Find a Film, the backend of pieflix checks the list of returned movie queries from TMDb, and compares it to a list of the user's previously paired movies. Movies not found in the previously paired list are then placed into a list of possible selections, and a movie is selected randomly from that list. In this way, a user should not receive the same pizza-movie pairing twice. The exceptions to this are:
    1. If the user choses to search via Pick a Pizza, and inputs a movie they have previously paired.
    2. The user deletes the previous pair; in which case the pair would not be included in the previously paired movie list.
